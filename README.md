# Haxball Headless Bot

- [Stable version (v6)](https://github.com/uzayyli/Haxball-Headless-Bot/tree/main/v6): tested, has no known bugs, also very lightweight
- [Experimental version (v7)](https://github.com/uzayyli/Haxball-Headless-Bot/tree/main/v7): Still under development, has more features and usability, but may contain some bugs. Use with caution!

Each folder has its own Readme file. Wiki is for v6 now, v7's help functions should be self-explanatory!
